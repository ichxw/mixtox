**Dose-Response Curve Fitting and Mixture Toxicity Assessment**
### Description
* Curve Fitting for monotonic(sigmoidal) & non-monotonic(J-shaped) 
concentration-response data. Prediction of mixture toxicity based on reference 
models such as 'concentration addition', 'independent action', and 'generalized 
concentration addition'.

### Introduction
* Curve fitting of concentration-responses based on 13 monotonic(sigmoidal) and 4 
non-monotonic(J-shaped) models, goodness of fit, and calculation of confidence interval 
* Experimental design for mixture toxicity
  * acr: arbitrary concentration ratio
  * eecr: equal effect concentration ratio
  * udcr: uniform design concentration ratio
* Mixture toxicity prediction based on reference models such as concentration addition (CA), 
	independent action (IA), and generalized concentration addition (GCA).
